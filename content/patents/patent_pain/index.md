description: "automated pain testing in mice"
summary: "Preclinical pain testing traditionally
utilizes techniques—such as stimulating
by hand and measuring responses by
eye—that limit reproducibility. We describe a device for consistent
stimulation and withdrawal measurement
with millisecond precision. Testing can be
fully automated, increasing
standardization and throughput while
objectively quantifying non-evoked
behaviors."
